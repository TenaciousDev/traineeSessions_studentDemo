## 1. What is a README?

- A text file meant to be read prior to viewing the content that introduces and explains the project!

- So we can view the README first, best practice is to put the file in the top level directory of the project.

- These should be written in a plain and easy to understand format so everyone can know what your project is and does.

- The file type is a .md, meaning it's a markdown file! It has its own [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax.

## 2. Markdown Basics

Markdown is considered a **markup language**. It makes use of easy-to-type symbols to allow basic formatting of text without the need for a formatting GUI such as the toolbar of Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

Markdown can be written in any text editor and will appear as plain text, but if you pass it in to a [Markdown parser](https://markdown-it.github.io/), you'll get formatted text!
